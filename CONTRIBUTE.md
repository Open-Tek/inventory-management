Before getting started please make sure you have all the above skills

Perform the following steps to start your contribution to our organization.
1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to [FEATURES.MD](FEATURES.MD) to see the list of features available to develop. FEATURES.MD contains link to description about each and every feature of the project. The crossed out features means that the feature has been already implemented.
4. After you have selected the feature of your choice, contact anyone of the member of the organization and inform him/her that your starting to implement the selected feature so that they can track the progress. 
5. Now create a branch with name "feature/<name_of_the_feature>".

## Bug reporting

We appreciate your effort to improve inventory-management by submitting a bug report. Before doing so, please check the following things: 

1. Check whether the bug you face **hasn't been already reported**. Duplicate reports takes us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements. 
3. If you got some error, please **describe what happened** and add error message. Reports like "I get error when I clicked on some link." are useless. 
Thanks for your help! 

Please report [bugs on GitHub][1].

## Patches submission

Patches are welcome as [pull requests on GitHub][2].  Please include a
Signed-off-by tag in the commit message (you can do this by passing `--signoff`
parameter to Git). 

When creating the commit on GitHub or using some other tool which does not have
direct support for this, it is the same as adding 
`Signed-off-by: Your name <email@example.com>`
as the last line of the commit message.

Note that by submitting patches with the Signed-off-by tag, you are giving
permission to license the patch as MIT Liscense.  See [the DCO file][3] for
details.
