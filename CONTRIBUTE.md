# Contributing to open-tek

As an open source organization, open-tek welcomes contributions of many forms.

## Bug reporting

We appreciate your effort to improve inventory-management by submitting a bug report. Before doing so, please check the following things: 

1. Check whether the bug you face **hasn't been already reported**. Duplicate reports takes us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements. 
3. If you got some error, please **describe what happened** and add error message. Reports like "I get error when I clicked on some link." are useless. 
Thanks for your help! 

Please report [bugs on GitHub][1].

## Patches submission

Patches are welcome as [pull requests on GitHub][2].  Please include a
Signed-off-by tag in the commit message (you can do this by passing `--signoff`
parameter to Git). 

When creating the commit on GitHub or using some other tool which does not have
direct support for this, it is the same as adding 
`Signed-off-by: Your name <email@example.com>`
as the last line of the commit message.

Note that by submitting patches with the Signed-off-by tag, you are giving
permission to license the patch as MIT Liscense.  See [the DCO file][3] for
details.
